# Facebook-Hacker
This project is a google chrome extension, written in json and javascript, and works on a basic find and replace principle 
for searching text. In an input field in the extension popup, you enter a word or phrase to find, and then in the replace field,
the word or phrase you want to replace it with. When you click submit, the script runs on the markup/html on whatever page
you have open in your current tab, finding and replacing all instances of that word/phrase. I have called it 'Facebook Hacker'
as a common use for this extension might be on facebook, where you can change your news feed, or others statuses.
